"""A program that solves the N queens problem.

Determines all possible ways of placing N
non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.

N must be an integer greater or equal to 4.

Attributes:
    board (list): A list of lists representing the chessboard.
    solutions (list): A list of lists containing solutions.

Solutions are represented in the form of
[[row, col], [row, col], [row, col], [row, col].
A queen must be placed on the chessboard."""
